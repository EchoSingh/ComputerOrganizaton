##Computer organization

Digital computer/simply Computer : are the High Speed electronic computing machine that takes digital input process it with list of instructions stored locally and produces the output information .
the list of instructions are called : computer programs.
where they stored locally is called : computer memmory.

The computer are differ in their cost,size,computation power,and intend of use.
1.Personal Computer : The most common computer are the personal computers they are used in schools , homes,businness.It is the form of Desktop computer.
2.Desktop Computer : these are the computers that have processing and storage unit,a display and audio as output unit and a keyboard as input unit.
                     the storage device contain harddisk,CD-ROMS,and the diskette(a agnetic disk enclosed in stiff envellop with radial slit)simply a floppy disk.
3.Notebook computer : These are portable computer . they are the compact form of desktop computer where all the components are stored in a single unit with thw thin size of the briefcase.
4.Workstations : these are within the dimensions of the Desktop Computers but with higher computation speed and memory they are basically used in enginnering for model training ,etc.
5.The more powerful and sppedy than workstation are these following  computers (high resolution input/output) :
    1.(at low end):
        1.enterprise systems or(mainframes): these are build for dataprocessing in the medium to large corporation which require high computation speed.
        2.Servers : these have stabalize batadase storage unit for handling high number of requests.these request are transported with the help of the internet.this internet are becomming dominat info sharing worlwide.
                    internets have optical fibre for the speedy data info sharing.
        3.Super Computers : Thse are build to provide higher numerical computations.
